# Charts with HTML/CSS
    
    - [ ] It's possible to create charts using just HTML and CSS. (Give it a try?)
    
    - [ ] Creating charts manually is a lot of work. Better is to use a scripting language, like Javascript. See, e.g.,
    
      * https://css-tricks.com/making-charts-with-css/
      * Eric Meyer has [an old-school method](https://meyerweb.com/eric/css/edge/bargraph/demo-table.html), using tables
      * If you want to try adding scripts, experiment with [Google Charts](https://google-developers.appspot.com/chart/)
